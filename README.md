<p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kgMOwK3Hvl9qedhFxxRxU04NU001gjAafCrqJr1HqKc/edit#">Documentation/Prototype</a> </p>

<p> Team name: Team JV Basketball </p>
<p> Team members: Skai Nzeuton, Aahan Mehta </p>
<p> Basic Pac-Man with features such as power ups and multiple map options. If we have time, we plan to implement the actual behaviors of the ghosts from the actual Pac-Man. Having accurate level advancement and scoring would also be another long term goal. Implementing the actual sound effects and multiple color themes would also be a nice touch. </p>
